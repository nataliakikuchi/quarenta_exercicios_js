/*EXERCÍCIO
You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as its key. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an album's id (like 2548), a property prop (like "artist" or "tracks"), and a value (like "Addicted to Love") to modify the data in this collection.

If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value for that record album's property.

Your function must always return the entire collection object.

There are several rules for handling incomplete data:

If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.

If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the end of the album's existing tracks array.

If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.

Hints
Use bracket notation when accessing object properties with variables.

Push is an array method you can read about on Mozilla Developer Network.

You may refer back to Manipulating Complex Objects Introducing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for a refresher.*/

/* Problem Explanation:
You are given a JSON object representing (a small part of) your record collection. Each album is identified by a unique id number and has several properties. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an id, a property (prop), and a value.

For the given id in collection:

If value is non-blank (value !== ""), then update or set the value for the prop.

If the prop is “tracks” and value is non-blank, check to see if the given element in the array has the property of “tracks”. If the element has the property of “tracks”, push the value onto the end of the “tracks” array. If the element does not have the property, create the property and value pair.

If value is blank, delete that prop.

Always return the entire collection object.

Change the code below // Only change code below this line and up to // Alter values below to test your code.
Take note that you are editing the inside of the updateRecords function.
For the given id parameter, which is associated to the collection object:

If the value parameter isn’t an empty string, update (or set) the value parameter for the prop parameter.
If the prop parameter is equal to "tracks" and the value isn’t an empty string, push the value onto the end of the tracks array.
If value is an empty string, delete that prop from the object.
Finally, return the collection object. */

var collection = {
    "2548": {
      "album": "Slippery When Wet",
      "artist": "Bon Jovi",
      "tracks": [
        "Let It Rock",
        "You Give Love a Bad Name"
      ]
    },
    "2468": {
      "album": "1999",
      "artist": "Prince",
      "tracks": [
        "1999",
        "Little Red Corvette"
      ]
    },
    "1245": {
      "artist": "Robert Palmer",
      "tracks": [ ]
    },
    "5439": {
      "album": "ABBA Gold"
    }
};
// Keep a copy of the collection for tests
var collectionCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(collection));

// Only change code below this line
function updateRecords(id, prop, value) {
  if (prop === "tracks" && value !== "") {
   if(collection[id][prop]) {
    collection[id][prop].push(value);
   }
   else {
    collection[id][prop]=[value];
   }
  } else if (value !== "") {
    collection[id][prop] = value;
  } else {
    delete collection[id][prop];
  }

  return collection;
}



// Alter values below to test your code
updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA");

/*Code Explanation:
First checks if prop is equal to tracks AND if value isn’t a blank string. If both tests pass, value is pushed into the tracks array.
If that first check doesn’t pass, it next checks only if value isn’t a blank string. If that test passes, either a new key (prop) and value (value) are added to the object, or an existing key is updated if the prop already exists.
If both these checks fail (meaning value must be an empty string), then the key (prop) is removed from the object.
Example Run

updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA"); runs.
prop is equal to “artist”, not “tracks”, so the first part of the else if statement fails.
value is not a blank string, so the second part of the else if statement passes.
artist: "ABBA" is added to the 5439 id.*/
